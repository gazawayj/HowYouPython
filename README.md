# HowYouFeelin_Python 
## The 'How You Feelin?' Python Branch that will SURELY accomplish something.

###### Project to learn python or something that will grow? We'll see.

'How You Feelin?' is designed with the ill in mind. The goal of this software is to 
one day allow users to produce quality, doctor-worthy health reports that are able to 
be created, edited, deleted, and shared anywhere in the world. With wearable peripherals 
as the end-goal, 'How You Feelin?' dreams to one day be a conveinant and informative way 
to keep track of your health.

I'm still not sure what to use this branch for. Perhaps something as simple as API? Maybe 
see if I can utilize machine learning in order to make preliminary assessments based off
of gathered data?
